Just a little python module that fetchs the ETH/USD ticker in real time from the Delta's Exchange API.

You can either launch the main script wich will call the module with

```
$/> python3 main.py
```

or you can also launch the module directly and it will fetch the ticker for you too with

```
$/> python3 tickerfetcher.py
```
